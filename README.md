# README
Currently set to autodeploy to https://figurehq.herokuapp.com/ 

#TODO (css and assets not serving correctly just yet)

## Running locally
*Will be iterating a lot on this over the next few hours so I can't guarantee the following will always work
1. clone repo
2. run `bundle install` and `yarn install`
3. run the server with `rails s --binding=127.0.0.1`
